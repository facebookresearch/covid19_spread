#+TITLE: Experiment TODOs

** Data Analysis
*** Overdispersion
- To motivate the use of the negative binomial distribution, we need to show
  that the data is overdispersed
- Since we have a time-varying process, we can not simply compute mean and
  variance for the entire time series.
- Instead, we should compute mean and variance for each 1-2 week period
  separately and show that variance is larger than the mean
- Analysis should be done on county level
- Think about good way to visualize this


** Main Experiment
*** Setting
- Forecast Deaths and Confirmed Cases
- Weekly backfill on US Nytimes data
- Weekly backfill on Italy/Spain (others?)
- Separate forecast horizons (allows us to also do CV on earlier days)
  - 7 days
  - 14 days
  - 21 days
*** Baselines
- [ ] Standard AR model (univariate)
- [ ] Standard AR model (multivariate)
- [ ] S(E)IR
- [ ] MHPs
- [ ] Naive

** Ablation
- [ ] Univariate AR model
- [ ] Multivariate AR model
- [ ] Without Negative Binomial
- [ ] Without Latent Beta
- [ ] Without Coupling
