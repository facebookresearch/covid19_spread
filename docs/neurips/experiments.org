#+TITLE: Experiment TODOs

** Data Analysis
*** Overdispersion
- To motivate the use of the negative binomial distribution, we need to show
  that the data is overdispersed
- Since we have a time-varying process, we can not simply compute mean and
  variance for the entire time series.
- Instead, we should compute mean and variance for each 1-2 week period
  separately and show that variance is larger than the mean
- Analysis should be done on county level
- Think about good way to visualize this


** Main Experiment
*** Setting
- Forecast Deaths and Confirmed Cases
- Weekly backfill on US Nytimes data
- Weekly backfill on Italy/Spain (others?)
- Separate forecast horizons (allows us to also do CV on earlier days)
  - 7 days: ["2020-04-01", "2020-04-08", "2020-04-15", "2020-04-22", "2020-04-29", "2020-05-06", "2020-05-13", "2020-05-20"]
  - 14 days: ["2020-04-01", "2020-04-08", "2020-04-15", "2020-04-22", "2020-04-29", "2020-05-06", "2020-05-13"]
  - 21 days: ["2020-04-01", "2020-04-08", "2020-04-15", "2020-04-22", "2020-04-29", "2020-05-06"]
