  abstract        = {Background The negative binomial distribution is used
                  commonly throughout biology as a model for overdispersed count
                  data, with attention focused on the negative binomial
                  dispersion parameter, k. A substantial literature exists on
                  the estimation of k, but most attention has focused on
                  datasets that are not highly overdispersed (i.e., those with
                  k≥1), and the accuracy of confidence intervals estimated for k
                  is typically not explored. Methodology This article presents a
                  simulation study exploring the bias, precision, and confidence
                  interval coverage of maximum-likelihood estimates of k from
                  highly overdispersed distributions. In addition to exploring
                  small-sample bias on negative binomial estimates, the study
                  addresses estimation from datasets influenced by two types of
                  event under-counting, and from disease transmission data
                  subject to selection bias for successful outbreaks.
                  Conclusions Results show that maximum likelihood estimates of
                  k can be biased upward by small sample size or under-reporting
                  of zero-class events, but are not biased downward by any of
                  the factors considered. Confidence intervals estimated from
                  the asymptotic sampling variance tend to exhibit coverage
                  below the nominal level, with overestimates of k comprising
                  the great majority of coverage errors. Estimation from
                  outbreak datasets does not increase the bias of k estimates,
                  but can add significant upward bias to estimates of the mean.
                  Because k varies inversely with the degree of overdispersion,
                  these findings show that overestimation of the degree of
                  overdispersion is very rare for these datasets.},

                  contact data from the POLYMOD study. The proposed

                  homogeneous or no mixing between age groups. An extended

                  by, e.g., timely recognizing emerging outbreaks in case of

                  implies the use of appropriate methods for monitoring time

                  tools for such automatic aberration detection offered by the R

                  visualization, modeling and monitoring of surveillance time
                  series. With respect to modeling we focus on univariate time
                  series modeling based on generalized linear models (GLMs),
                  multivariate GLMs, generalized additive models and generalized
                  additive models for location, shape and scale. Applications of
                  such modeling include illustrating implementational
                  improvements and extensions of the well-known Farrington
                  algorithm, e.g., by spline-modeling or by treating it in a
                  Bayesian context. Furthermore, we look at categorical time
                  series and address overdispersion using beta-binomial or
                  Dirichlet-multinomial modeling. With respect to monitoring we
                  consider detectors based on either a Shewhart-like single
                  timepoint comparison between the observed count and the
                  predictive distribution or by likelihoodratio based cumulative
                  sum methods. Finally, we illustrate how surveillance can
                  support aberration detection in practice by integrating it
                  into the monitoring workflow of a public health institution.
                  Altogether, the present article shows how well surveillance
                  can support automatic aberration detection in a public health
                  surveillance context.},
