#+BEGIN_abstract
Forecasting COVID-19 poses unique challenges due to the novelty of the disease,
its unknown characteristics, and substantial but varying interventions to reduce
its spread. To improve the quality and robustness of forecasts, we propose a new
method which employs Granger causality as an inductive bias and aims to
disentangle region-specific aspects -- such as demographics, enacted policies,
and testing methods -- from disease-inherent aspects that influence its spread.
This allows us to train high-resolution models by borrowing statistical strength
across regions. In our experiments, we demonstrate that this approach achieves
strong performance in predicting the spread of COVID-19.

* Introduction
Modeling the spread of COVID-19 at a high spatial and temporal resolution has
become an important task in the public health response to the disease. For
instance, it is not only central to monitor the state of the pandemic but is
also important to efficiently allocate scarce resources such as ventilators,
personal protective equipment, and ICU beds.

[[file:img/cases_italy.png]]

However, forecasting COVID-19 poses unique challenges as it is still largely
unknown to what extent certain factors influence its spread. This is only
exacerbated by the little data that exists about the disease and how it spreads.
Even several months after the initial outbreak there exists substantially less
data than for infectious diseases like influenza and measles which have been
monitored for decades. Due to the global nature of COVID-19, the available data
is also distributed among regions with very different properties, many of which
may affect its spread. This includes, for instance, demographics and population
densities, enacted policies, adherence to those policies, mobility patterns, and
geographic features such as temperature. In addition, testing and reporting can
change considerably across regions and time what adds another source of
variability and uncertainty. All these factors make reliable forecasts
difficult, especially at high spatial resolution. While flexible models are
needed to account for all these a possible influencing factors there is little data
to estimate such models reliably and without overfitting.

To alleviate this issue, we propose to employ /Granger
causality/ as an inductive bias to improve forecast quality. Although there
exists considerable variability across locations and time, the spread of the disease is
also governed by common, disease-inherent properties. Once a model has correctly
accounted for region-specific dynamics, information about the spread of the
disease in region $j$ should therefore also help to improve predictions
for a related region $i$. Based on this assumption, our method then aims to
learn models that increase Granger causality between regions.
For this purpose, we use standard autoregressive models and a
specific regularization scheme that increases the coupling between regions.
Notably, this approach optimizes the opposite objective as often used in causal
discovery where coupling between regions is penalized, e.g., via $\ell_1$
regularization.

* Method
We consider forecasting of time series that are different realizations of
the same underlying disease process. Let \(\foi_i^{t}\) denote the /force of
infection/ at time \(t\) in location \(i\).[fn::Given $y^t_i$ infected
individuals, the force of infection (or hazard) models the probability that a
susceptible individual at time $t$ will become infected by time $t+1$. Classic
epidemological models (e.g., SIR, AR) and quantities ($R_0$) can be expressed in terms
of $\foi_i^t$. See citet:bauer2018stratified for a detailed discussion.]
We then assume that $\foi_i^t$ can be decomposed into a time-dependent
component $\beta_i^t$ and a time-independent component $\foi$ such that
\begin{align*}
\foi_i^t = \beta_i^t \foi \quad\text{where}\quad \beta_i^t \in [0, 1],\, \foi > 0
\end{align*}

Hence, $\beta_i^t$ can be understood as a dampening factor of the underlying
force of infection that depends on time and location. While
some influencing factors for the evolution of $\beta_i^t$ might be know (e.g.,
mobility, population density, etc.), we assume that the full set of influencing
factors is unknown. We will therefore regard $\beta_i^t$ as a latent variable whose state
can depend on observed variables $\vec{x}_i^t$. There exist many possible ways
to model the evolution of $\beta_i^t$ in this scenario. In the following, we will
simply use a /Elman RNN/ where
\begin{align}
    \beta_i^t & = \sigma(\vec{w}^\top \vec{z}_t)
    & \vec{z}_t & = \psi(W_z\vec{h}^t_i + \vec{b}_z) \label{eq:rnn} \\
    && \vec{h}_t & = \psi(W_h\vec{x}_i^t + U\vec{h}^{t-1}_i + \vec{b}_h)\notag
\end{align}
and where $\sigma$ and $\psi$ denote sigmoid and tanh non-linearities.

** Granger Causality as an Inductive Bias
Although an RNN as in ref:eq:rnn should provide enough capacity to model the
evolution of $\beta_i^t$, there exists currently not enough data about the
spread of COVID-19 to estimate its parameters without overfitting. We seek
therefore inductive biases which allows us to estimate $\beta_i^t$ from few
observations. Since all regions are affected by the same underlying disease
process, we assume that information about the spread in region $j$ should also
help to predict the spread in region $i$ -- once we have accounted for time- and
location-dependent dynamics. A good model of $\beta_i^t$ should therefore help
to improve the predictions of $y_i^{t+1} / \beta_i^t$ from cases in other
regions $y_j^t$. We interpret this inductive bias in terms of Granger causality,
which is defined as follows: Let $X^t=\{X_t\}_{i=1}^t$, $Y^t=\{Y_t\}_{i=1}^t$,
$Z^t=\{Z_t\}_{i=1}^t$ denote stochastic processes and let $L$ denote a loss
function. Furthermore, let $\risk(Y^{t+1} | Y^t, Z^t) = \E(L(Y_{t+1}, f(Y^t,
Z^t)))$ denote the expected loss (risk) of a predictor $f$. We then say $X$
Granger-causes $Y$ if its inclusion in the predictor significantly improves the
forecast, i.e., if
\begin{equation}
    \risk(Y^{t+1} | Y^t, X^t, Z^t) \ll \risk(Y^{t+1} | Y^t, Z^t)
\end{equation}

For a /multivariate autoregressive/ model, it is known that Granger causality is
directly linked to its coefficients. In particular, let
\begin{equation} \AR(p): \quad y_i^{t+1} =
\sum_{\ell=0}^{p-1} \sum_{j=1}^m \lambda_{ij}^\ell y_j^{t - \ell}
\end{equation}
be a multivariate autoregressive model of order $p$. /A time series $y_j$ is
then Granger causing $y_i$ if and only if $\lambda_{ij} \neq 0$/
citep:Seth2007granger. For causal discovery, coefficients $\lambda_{ij}$ are
therefore often \(\ell_1\)-regularized. Here, we take the opposite approach and
seek solutions in which as many time-series as possible are Granger-causal
related. However, we do not force /all/ time series to be related since this is
likely an unrealistic constraint. Instead, we assume $\lambda_{ij}$ are drawn
from a logit-normal distribution citep:atchison1980logistic, what allows us to
specify a prior on the ratio of related-to-unrelated time series.

In particular, let \(\Set{Y} = \{(y_i^1, \ldots, y_i^T)\}_{i=1}^m\) denote the
observed realizations where $i$ indexes locations and where $T$ denotes the
maximum observation time. Furthermore, let $\sigma(\cdot)$ denote the
logistic function and let $\lambda_{ij} = \sigma(\alpha_{ij})$. We then
model the spread of the disease via the time-varying and location-dependent model
\begin{equation}
\bAR(p): \quad y_i^{t+1} = &
\sum_{\ell=0}^{p-1} \sum_{j=1}^m \beta_i^t\lambda_{ij}^\ell y_j^{t - \ell} \label{eq:beta-ar}
\end{equation}
To incorporate Granger causality as an inductive bias, we regularize the
model log-likelihood such that $\alpha_{ij}$ is drawn from a logit-normal
distribution with location $\mu$ and scale $\gamma$. Let $\theta$ denote
the model parameters (i.e., $\alpha_{ij}$ as well as parameters of the RNN).
and let $p_\theta(y)$ denote the likelihood function of the $\bAR$
model. Furthermore, let $q$ denote the PDF of the logit-normal
distribution. We then maximize the regularized objective
\begin{equation}
\max_{\theta}\sum_y\log p_\theta(y) + \eta \sum_{ij} \log q(\alpha_{ij}\,|\,\mu,\gamma). \label{eq:objective}
\end{equation}
We regard $\eta, \mu, \gamma > 0$ as hyperparameters which allow us to control
the ratio of related and unrelated time series in terms of Granger causality.

** Accounting for Overdispersion
Count data such as confirmed cases is naturally modeled using Poisson
distributions. However, COVID-19 case counts exhibit substantial overdispersion,
i.e., the variance of the observed counts can significantly exceed their mean
(e.g., see cref:fig:dispersion). For this
reason, we will model case counts with Negative Binomial distributions what
allows us to account for varying degrees of overdispersion. Specifically, we set
\begin{align*}
    y^{t+1}_{i} & \sim \text{NB}(\mu_i^{t}, \nu_i) \\
    \mu^t_i & = \sum_{\ell=0}^{p-1} \sum_{j=1}^m \beta_i^t \lambda_{ij}^\ell y_j^{t - \ell}
\end{align*}
where \(\mu_i\) and \(\nu_i\) are mean and dispersion parameter of the
distribution and $\mu_i$ is modeled  using the \bAR model of
cref:eq:beta-ar.
The likelihood function in cref:eq:objective is then of the form
\begin{equation*}
p_\theta(y) = \frac{\Gamma(y + \nu)}{y!\Gamma(\nu)}\left(\frac{\mu}{\mu +\nu}\right)^{y}\left(1 + \frac{\mu}{\nu}\right)^{-\nu}
\quad \mu > 0, \nu > 0
\end{equation*}

** COMMENT Transfer Entropy and Granger Causality
Transfer entropy measures the directed, time-asymmetric transfer of information
between two random processes $Y_i$ and $Y_j$. Intuitively, it captures the amount of
uncertainty reduced in future values of $Y_i$ by knowing the past values of $Y_j$ given
past values of Y. Formally, \[ T_{j \to i} = p_\theta(y^{t+1}_i, \Set{Y}^t) \log
\frac{p_\theta(y^{t+1} | \Set{Y}^t)}{p_\theta(y^{t+1} | \Set{Y}^t \textbackslash
y^t_j)} \]

* Related Work
We build on prior work that has proposed to use autoregressive models
for spatially and temporally aggregated surveillance data of endemic-epidemic
processes citep:held2005statistical,meyer2014powerlaw,meyer2016socialcontact.
Such autoregressive models are, for instance, used to monitor infectious
diseases by public health agencies like the Robert Koch Institute
citep:salmon2016surveillance.

Moreover, the negative binomial distribution has become a popular way to model
infectious diseases, largely to its ability to model count data with varying degrees
of overdispersion citep:lloyd_smith2007negativebinomial. Autoregressive models
in combination with negative binomial distributions have, for instance, been
used by citet:bauer2018stratified,wakefield2019spatio,held2005statistical to
model infectious disease count data.

citet:valdes2005estimating proposed a combination of VAR(1) models and $\ell_1$
regularization to for the discovery of Granger-causal relations to understand
brain connectivity. citet:haufe2010sparse proposed an improved estimator which
can be applied for VAR models of order $p > 1$.

* Experiments
We compare predictions of the proposed \bAR model to cite:forecasts/lanl (LANL)
and cite:forecasts/yyg (YYG). Both LANL and YYG forecast on state-level while we
performed our forecasts on county-level. For comparison, we therefore aggregate
our forecasts to state-level. The YYG model is based on an extended SEIR model
which models the dynamics of the disease through explicit parameters for disease
and other mitigation effects.[fn::This includes, for instance, social
distancing, lockdown fatigue etc.] YYG is trained on confirmed deaths and
population data. For the \beta-\AR model, we only use confirmed deaths as
training and the only hyper parameters are model order $p$,
