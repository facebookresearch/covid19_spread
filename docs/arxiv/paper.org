#+BEGIN_abstract
Forecasting COVID-19 poses unique challenges due to the novelty of the disease,
its unknown characteristics, and substantial but varying interventions to reduce
its spread. To improve the quality and robustness of forecasts, we propose a new
method which aims to disentangle region-specific factors -- such as
demographics, enacted policies, and mobility -- from disease-inherent factors
that influence its spread. For this purpose, we combine recurrent neural
networks with a vector autoregressive model and train the joint model with a
specific regularization scheme that increases the coupling between regions. This
approach is akin to inducing Granger causality in the autoregressive part and
allows us to train high-resolution models by borrowing statistical strength
across regions. In our experiments, we observe that our method achieves strong
performance in predicting the spread of COVID-19 when compared to
state-of-the-art forecasts.

* Introduction
Modeling the spread of COVID-19 at a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e.,
confirmed cases at county or admin-3 level) has become an important task in the
public health response to the disease. For instance, accurate county-level
forecasts are not only central to monitor the state of the pandemic but are also
important to efficiently allocate scarce resources such as ventilators, personal
protective equipment, and ICU beds; and to make progress towards efficient early
detection systems.

[[file:img/growth_example.png]]

However, forecasting COVID-19 poses unique challenges -- in particular when
considering confirmed cases at high spatial resolution. Although there has been
considerable progress towards understanding the spread of the disease, there
still exists only limited data and knowledge about important factors that
influence its spread. This is only exacerbated by the naturally larger
noise-levels in county-level data as compared to more highly aggregated state-level
data. Due to the global nature of COVID-19, the available data is also
distributed among regions with very different properties, many of which may
affect its spread. This includes, for instance, demographics and population
densities, enacted policies, adherence to those policies, mobility patterns, and
geographic features such as temperature. In addition, testing and reporting can
change considerably across regions and time. All these factors lead to
considerable variablity (see also ref:fig:county-variability) and uncertainty in
the data and makes reliable forecasts at high spatial resolution difficult.

To alleviate these issues, we propose a new method for predicting the spread of
COVID-19 by combining recurrent neural networks with a vector autoregressive
model and a specific regularization relational scheme. Our approach is motivated
by two main aspects: First, we seek to develop an end-to-end differentiable
model as this allows us to make efficient use of the limited available data
while also enabling us estimate parameters of powerful models that can capture
the large variability of cases across locations and time. However, while such
flexible models are needed to account for all possible influencing factors there
is little data to estimate them reliably and without overfitting. For this
reason, we seek, second, to disentangle region- and time-specific factors from
disease-inherent factors that influence its spread. This allows us to borrow
statistical strength between regions by coupling their predictions -- based on
the assumption that once a model has correctly accounted for region-specific
dynamics, information about the spread of the disease in region $j$ should
therefore also help to improve predictions for a related region $i$. This
approach is akin to using /Granger causality/ as an inductive bias to improve
forecast quality and robustness.

Compared to existing state-of-the-art forecasting models, our method takes a
highly data-driven approach with fewer modeling assumptions as, for instance, in
very detailed compartmental models. As such we see our approach as complimentary
to existing models which provides strong forecasting performance at the cost of
reduced interpretability.


* Neural Relational Autoregression
We consider the forecasting of \(m\) time series that are different realizations
of the same underlying disease process. Let \({\Set{Y} = \{(y_i^1, \ldots,
y_i^T)\}_{i=1}^m}\) denote the observed case counts where $i$ indexes locations
and where $T$ denotes the maximum observation time. Furthermore, let
$\Set{Y}(\tau) = \{(y_i^t : t \leq \tau)\}_{i=1}^m$ denote the set of all
observed case counts up to time $\tau \leq T$. We then model the case counts as
random variables
\begin{equation*}
    Y^{t+1}_i\ |\ \Set{Y}(t) \sim f(\foi_i^t)
\end{equation*}
where \(\foi_i^{t}\) denotes the /force of infection/[fn::Given $y^t_i$ infected
individuals, the force of infection (or hazard) models the probability that a
susceptible individual at time $t$ will become infected by time $t+1$] at time
\(t\) in location \(i\) and where $f(x)$ denotes a probability distribution with
parameter \(x\) (e.g., a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution).

Due to the different interventions during the course of the epidemic, we regard
$\Set{Y}$ as a time-varying process that is influenced by external factors such
as policies, mobility, etc. For this reason, we decompose $\foi_i^t$ into a
time-specific component $\beta_i^t$ and a time-indepedent component
$\foi_i$ such that
\begin{align*}
\foi_i^t = \beta_i^t \foi_i \quad\text{where}\quad \beta_i^t \in [0, 1],\, \foi_i > 0
\end{align*}

Hence, $\beta_i^t$ can be understood as a dampening factor of the underlying
force of infection which models the effect of interventions and depends on time
and location. While some influencing factors for the evolution of $\beta_i^t$
might be known (e.g., mobility, population density, etc.), we assume that the
full set of influencing factors is unknown and will regard $\beta_i^t$
as a latent variable.

Using this decomposition, we then model the time-independent force of
infection as a autoregressive model of order \(p\),[fn::AR models
where \[Y_i^{t+1}\ |\ \Set{Y}(t) \sim \text{Poisson}(\foi_i^t)\] can be
interpreted as approximations of Reed-Frost chain binomial SIR models. For a
detailed discussion see citep:bauer2018stratified.] i.e.,
\begin{align}
    \text{AR}(p): \foi_i = \sum_{\ell=0}^{p-1} w^\ell y_i^{t - \ell} \label{eq:foi-ar}
\end{align}
where $\{w^\ell > 0\}_{l=0}^{p-1}$ are the parameters of the model which are
shared across locations $i$. For the time-depdendent dampening $\beta_i^t$ we
employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such that
\begin{align}
    \text{RNN}: \beta_i^t = f_\theta(\{x_i^k\}_{k=0}^t) \label{eq:rnn}
\end{align}
where $\theta$ are the parameters of the network which are again shared across
locations and where $\{x_i^k\}_{k=0}^t$ denote observed input features to the
RNN (e.g., mobility in location $i$ at time $k$). Although an RNN as in
ref:eq:rnn has enough capacity to model the evolution of $\beta_i^t$, the
limited data about the spread of COVID-19 makes it challenging to estimate its
parameters without overfitting. We seek therefore an inductive bias which allows
us to estimate $\beta_i^t$ from few observations.

** Relational Inductive Bias

Since all regions are affected by the same underlying process, we assume that
information about the spread in region $i$ should also help to predict the
spread in region $j$ -- once we have accounted for time- and location-dependent
dynamics. A good model of $\beta_i^t$ should therefore help to improve the
predictions of $y_i^{t+1} / \beta_i^t$ from cases in other regions $y_j^t$. We
interpret this inductive bias akin to Granger causality[fn::Granger causality is
defined as follows: Let ${X^t=\{X_t\}_{i=1}^t}$, ${Y^t=\{Y_t\}_{i=1}^t}$,
${Z^t=\{Z_t\}_{i=1}^t}$ denote stochastic processes and let $L$ denote a loss
function. Furthermore, let \[\risk(Y^{t+1} | Y^t, Z^t) = \E(L(Y_{t+1}, f(Y^t,
Z^t)))\] denote the expected loss (risk) of a predictor $f$. We then say $X$
/Granger-causes/ $Y$ if its inclusion in the predictor significantly improves
the forecast, i.e., if \[ \risk(Y^{t+1} | Y^t, X^t, Z^t) \ll \risk(Y^{t+1} |
Y^t, Z^t) \]] and extend ref:eq:foi-ar to a /vector autoregressive/ model where
it is known that Granger causality is directly linked to its coefficients. In
particular, let
\begin{equation} \text{VAR}(p): \foi_i =
\sum_{\ell=0}^{p-1} \sum_{j=1}^m w_{ij}^\ell y_j^{t - \ell}
\end{equation}
be a vector autoregressive model of order $p$. /A time series $y_j$ is then
Granger-causing $y_i$ if and only if $w_{ij} \neq 0$/ citep:Seth2007granger. For
causal discovery, coefficients $w_{ij}$ are therefore often
\(\ell_1\)-regularized. Here, we take the opposite approach and seek solutions
in which as many time-series as possible can be considered Granger-causal
related. However, we do not force all time series to be related since this is
likely an unrealistic constraint. Instead, we assume $\forall i \neq j : w_{ij}$
are drawn from a logit-normal distribution citep:atchison1980logistic, what
allows us to specify a prior on the proportion of related and unrelated time
series.

#+LATEX: \caption{The Logit-Normal distribution is a probability distribution of a random variable whose logit has a normal distribution, i.e., $\phi(\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma))$.}
#+LATEX: \end{marginfigure}

In particular, let $\phi(\cdot)$ denote the logistic function, let ${\forall i
\neq j : w_{ij} = \phi(\alpha_{ij})}$, and let $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$
denote the Normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Putting
everything together, we then model the full /time-varying/ force of infection as
\begin{align}
\bAR(p): \quad \foi^{t+1}_i & =
\beta_i^t \sum_{\ell=0}^{p-1}\sum_{j=1}^m w_{ij}^\ell y_j^{t - \ell} \label{eq:beta-ar} \\
    \alpha_{ij} & \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \quad \forall i \neq j \notag
\end{align}
Hence, the $\bAR$ model consists of a standard \AR\xspace component ($w_{ii} > 0$) and
a relational component ($w_{ij} \in [0, 1]$) which aims to couple the different
regions. The number of non-zero entries in the "adjacency matrix" $w_{ij}$ can
then be controlled through the logit-normal prior.

** Accounting for Overdispersion
Count data such as confirmed cases is naturally modeled using Poisson
distributions. However, COVID-19 case counts exhibit substantial overdispersion,
i.e., the variance of the observed counts can significantly exceed their mean
(e.g., see cref:fig:dispersion). For this
reason, we will model case counts with Negative Binomial distributions what
allows us to account for varying degrees of overdispersion. Specifically, we set
\begin{align*}
    y^{t+1}_{i} & \sim \text{NB}(\foi_i^{t}, \nu_i)
\end{align*}
where \(\foi^t_i\) and \(\nu_i\) are mean and dispersion parameter of the
distribution and $\foi^t_i$ is modeled using the \bAR model of cref:eq:beta-ar. The
likelihood function in cref:eq:objective is then of the form
\begin{equation*}
p_\theta(y) = \frac{\Gamma(y + \nu)}{y!\Gamma(\nu)}\left(\frac{\mu}{\mu +\nu}\right)^{y}\left(1 + \frac{\mu}{\nu}\right)^{-\nu}
\quad \mu > 0, \nu > 0
\end{equation*}

#+LATEX: \end{marginfigure}

** Parameter Estimation and Implementation Details
To estimate the parameters of the model, we regularize the
model log-likelihood such that $w_{ij}$ is drawn from a logit-normal
distribution with location $\mu$ and scale $\sigma$. Let $\theta$ denote
the model parameters (i.e., $\alpha_{ij}$ as well as parameters of the RNN).
and let $p_\theta(y)$ denote the likelihood function of the $\bAR$
model. Furthermore, let $q$ denote the prior normal
distribution for $\alpha_{ij}$. We then maximize the regularized log-likelihood
\begin{equation}
\max_{\theta}\sum_y\log p_\theta(y) + \sum_{ij} \log q(\alpha_{ij}\,|\,\mu,\sigma). \label{eq:objective}
\end{equation}
We regard $\mu, \sigma > 0$ as hyperparameters which allow us to control the
ratio of related and unrelated time series.

Since ref:eq:objective is end-to-end differentiable we can jointly estimate the
parameters of the entire model using gradient-based optimization. We compute
gradients via automatic differentiation using the PyTorch framework
citep:paszke2019pytorch. To maximize ref:eq:objective we then use the stochastic
optimization method AdamW citep:loshchilov2018decoupled where we decouple the
updates of the normally distributed parameters $\alpha_{ij}$ from the adaptive
updates of the remaining parameters.

* Results
In the following, we evaluate the forecast quality of our method compared to
multiple to multiple state-of-the-art forecasts for confirmed cases on
county-level. All comparison forecasts are collected from the COVID-19 Forecast
Hub[fn::\url{https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub}] as submitted by
the respective teams. The COVID-19 Forecast Hub features county-level forecasts
from July 5th onwards and we selected those models for which at least 10 forecasts
where available since then. The full list of comparison forecasts is shown in
ref:tab:forecasts.

\paragraph{Forecast setup and model selection} To compute forecasts for the
different dates in the test set, we use the following fully automated model
selection scheme: For each forecast date $d$, we perform cross-validation by
holding out additional 21 days of validation data and train the model on the
remaining data. We then select the best hyperparameters as measured by RMSE on
the validation set and retrain the whole model with those hyperparameters on the
combined training and validation set to compute the final forecast. When
computing the forecasts, we hold all additional input data (e.g., symptom
survey, mobility, weather, etc.) constant after the last observed day
$d$.[fn::This setting places natural limits on the duration of the forecasting
horizon. We reserve the joint forecasting of cases and covariates -- what could
extend the horizon -- for future work.]. For all training details of the model,
please see the supplementary material.


\paragraph{Input data} As input features for \bAR, we use multiple data sources as listed in
ref:tab:data-sources. Confirmed cases enter the model only in the autoregressive
part. All other covariates enter the model only as input features for the
time-varying \(\beta\)-part. For cases and weather data, we use the preprocessed data
from the Google COVID-19 Open Data repository citep:data/Wahltinez2020.

\paragraph{Forecast evaluation} ref:fig:mae-covidhub shows the forecast
quality as measured by MAE for multiple forecast horizons.[fn::MAE numbers are computed in accordance with \url{https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-forecast-hub-evaluation}] It can be seen that
the proposed \bAR models shows a consistently strong performance and is for all
forecasting dates and horizons either the best model or among the best.
ref:fig:ranking-covidhub-mae, which shows the ranking of all models by the
average MAE for each forecast horizon, further illustrates this property. It can
be seen that \bAR model is consistently ranked first over all horizons.
Furthermore, other models show much larger variability in their performance.

To also evaluate the performance of our model on days prior to July 5th, we
compare to forecasts of Google Cloud AI citep:arik2020interpretable and Columbia
University citep:forecasts/columbia which provide county-level forecasts of
confirmed cases from May 11th to June 27th. ref:fig:mae-google shows the average
MAE over all counties for 7 and 14 day forecasts for these models.[fn::For this
comparison, average MAE is computed as described in citep:arik2020interpretable]
It can be seen that the \bAR model shows again consistently strong performance on these
earlier days and is typically ranked first for both 7 and 14 day forecasts.

\paragraph{Ablations} In addition to comparisons to state-of-the-art
county-level forecasts, we also evaluate the contributions of different aspects
of our model. First, we test the effect of the relational autoregressive part.
For this purpose, we trained additional models were we disabled the relational
part (by setting $\forall i \neq j: w_{ij} = 0$) and compared their forecasts to
the full model of ref:eq:beta-ar. To measure the relative improvement of the
full model over the non-relational model, we compute then the relative error of
both models, e.g.,
\begin{equation*}
    \text{Relative Mean Absolute Error} = \frac{\text{MAE}_{\text{full}}}{\text{MAE}_\text{non-relational}}
\end{equation*}
It can be seen from ref:fig:quality-ratio that full model offers substantial
improvements over the non-relational model as the relative forecast quality
grows exponentially with the forecasting horizon. While the non-relational model
can offer acceptable forecast for horizons of 1-2 days, it quickly deteriorates
with larger horizons. This show the importance of the relational component for
disentangling the different growth factors and learning high quality models.

In addition to the non-relational component, we also evaluated the contributions
of the logit-normal regularization method. For this purpose, we trained a model
where we explicitly set the reqularization parameter $\sigma = 0$. We then
compare the forecast quality to the standard model where the regularization
parameter has been selected via cross-validation. ref:fig:mae-covidhub-granger
shows the results of the comparison. It can be seen that the logit-normal
regularization can be very beneficial to improve forecast quality. While the
differences to the standard model are much smaller than for the non-relational
model, the addition of the regularization term can lead to substantial
improvements, especially for horizons of 13 days and longer.

performed our forecasts on county-level. For comparison, we therefore aggregate
our forecasts to state-level. The YYG model is based on an extended SEIR model
which models the dynamics of the disease through explicit parameters for disease
and other mitigation effects.[fn::This includes, for instance, social
distancing, lockdown fatigue etc.] YYG is trained on confirmed deaths and
population data. For the \beta-\AR model, we only use confirmed deaths as
training and the only hyper parameters are model order $p$.
